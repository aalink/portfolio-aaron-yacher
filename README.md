Challenges
```
The biggest change in my approach for this update, which resulted in being the primary challenge, was the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  In the first version of the portfolio project, we were expected to create our own CSS to do both styling and responsive design. Bootstrap made the creation of a responsive design easier in several ways. However, figuring out how to use the large number of classes that are available consumed a considerable amount of time compared to other aspects of the project.
